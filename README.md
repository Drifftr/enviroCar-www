### Languages

Languages are currently managed as ``.php`` files in ``enviroCar-www\assets\includes`` named ``lang_[twoLetterIdentifierForLanguage].php``.

The selection of the language uses the browser's language and can be overridden by user settings, see ``enviroCar-www\assets\includes\languages.php``.


### Styles and CSS

Currently all our custom CSS goes either into the file ``assets/css/custom.css`` or into .php files, which is on our radar to be improved.
