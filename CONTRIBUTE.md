## Development

We have two branches:

* ``master`` is directly published as the main website https://envirocar.org
* ``dev`` is published as the development website https://envirocar.org/dev

### Beta testing

Use the development website **https://envirocar.org/dev** if you use enviroCar and tell us what you think, file bugs, ...

### Adding new features

We just the fork & pull development model, so please go ahead and fork the repo and start working **in the development branch**. After you have made your changes, create a pull request for the development branch of the main repository so that the developers can discuss your changes.

Then, the changes can be merged into the development branch and feedback from the community (email on the discuss mailing list) must be requested. After a waiting period and fixing all bugs, the development branch is merged with the master branch.

### Bug triage

* You can help report bugs by filing them here: https://github.com/enviroCar/enviroCar-www/issues
* You can look through the existing bugs here: https://github.com/enviroCar/enviroCar-www/issues

* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if
** The bug is reproducible? Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce? 


## Translations

Currently we have only two languages, but we look forward to add more - get in touch if you can contribute another language: envirocar@52north.org

## Documentation

All documentation should go into the README.md. You have a question that is not answered there? Let us know, create an issue and tag it "question".
